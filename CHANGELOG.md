# Changelog

All notable changes to this generator are documented in this file.
The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.
(This is the changelog of the **generator** itself, distinct from the `docs/release/CHANGELOG.md` of each generated app.)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-17
### Added
- App changelog + SemVer versioning system for generated apps: new `rules/versioning.md`, new `/python-release` skill, and a seeded `docs/release/CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog, English).
- Maintenance skills (`add-feature`, `fix-issue`, `refactor-code`, `migrate-design`) now record their change under `## [Unreleased]`; `/python-load-project` offers to initialize the changelog retroactively on a legacy app.

### Changed
- `CLAUDE.md`, `p5-development`, `verification.md`, `python-app`, `show-state` updated for the versioning system.

## [1.0.0]
- Unified edition baseline: 5-phase generation pipeline (p1 scoping to p5 development), calibration, strict MVC contract, error contract (named exceptions, toasts), Python/PySide6 security rules, design system v2.0 (depth by stroke, vendored Lucide SVGs), Salesforce `sf` v2 integration, and the maintenance skill set.
