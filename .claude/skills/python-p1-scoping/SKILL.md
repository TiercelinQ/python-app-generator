# /python-p1-scoping — Scoping

## Role
Project scoper — turn a vague idea into a bounded, validated scope.

## Goal
Lock the project parameters (DB, preferences, i18n, tests, icon, packaging, palette) before any analysis.

## Deliverable
`docs/specs/01-scoping.md` (written in the user's language) + on-screen summary.

## 1. Questions

**Phase banner (show first)** — on a new app, first list the 5 phases once (overview in `## PIPELINE` of `CLAUDE.md`). Then output the phase banner as plain Markdown in the user's language, **never inside a code block or fenced block**. Three blocks, each on its own line: (1) H2 heading: Phase 1/5 — Scoping; (2) progress line: ▶ Scoping · Features · Surfaces · Architecture · Development; (3) intent in italics: Destination folder, project parameters, palette.

Start with the objective, then establish the project root (folder name → location → creation), then ask the closed parameters with the `AskUserQuestion` tool (clickable options, the recommended one first). Cap = **4 questions per call** → **two calls**.

1. **Objective** — plain text, **not** `AskUserQuestion` (free-form, non-enumerable): "Application objective? (free description)".

### Project root (folder name → location → creation)

> Skip this block if a project root is already established for this flow.

- **Folder name** — propose 2-4 candidate names derived from the objective, **in kebab-case** (e.g. `expense-tracker`), the recommended one first, with `AskUserQuestion` (the **Other** option carries a custom name as free-form text). The user selects a candidate or types their own. This is the **project directory name**, distinct from the application name chosen in Phase 2.
- **Location** — free-form text: `Parent folder where to create the project? (path, e.g. C:\projects)`.
- **Create the folder** — project root = `[parent]\[folder-name]`. Create it, then confirm: `Project root: [path]`. If it already exists and is not empty, warn and ask the user to confirm reuse or pick another name. Store this path as the project root — all generated files and specs (`docs/specs/`) are written there.

### Closed parameters

> **Salesforce detection (before call 1)** — scan the objective text for the Salesforce cluster: `Salesforce`, `sf`/`sf CLI`, `org`, `scratch org`, `sandbox`, `Apex`, `SOQL`/`SOSL`, `sObject`, `metadata`/`deploy`/`retrieve`, `package`/`2GP`, `permission set`, `Dev Hub`, `Agentforce`. If any term is present, the **Salesforce CLI integration** question below switches its recommended default to `Yes` with a one-line rationale ("the objective mentions Salesforce"). The user still confirms — they may keep `No`. The single resolved Yes/No governs both @rules/sf-cli.md and the `sf-cli-reference/` catalog.

2. **`AskUserQuestion` — call 1** (4 questions, each with a recommended option):
   - **Database**: `SQLite` (recommended for structured data — sqlite3 stdlib) · `JSON` · `CSV` · `none`. PostgreSQL via the **Other** option.
   - **Persistent preferences** (theme, window…): `Yes` (recommended) · `No`.
   - **FR/EN i18n** (FR by default): `No` (recommended, unless a real EN need) · `Yes`.
   - **Automated tests** (pytest + pytest-qt): `Yes` (recommended, pro use) · `No`.
3. **`AskUserQuestion` — call 2** (3 questions):
   - **Application icon**: `No` (recommended — OS default, can be added later) · `Yes`. If `Yes`, ask the `.ico` path as free-form text (saved as `resources/icon.ico` — window/taskbar via `app.setWindowIcon`, packaging, and splash all reuse it).
   - **.exe packaging** (PyInstaller — build.spec + PowerShell script): `No` (recommended, unless distributing) · `Yes`.
   - **Salesforce CLI integration** (`sf` v2): default `No` (general-purpose app) — but **flip the recommended option to `Yes` when the Salesforce detection above matched** (state the rationale). If `Yes`, @rules/sf-cli.md applies (it routes to the `sf-cli-reference/` command catalog) and the default scaffold adds the `sf` runner + typed helpers + a starter Org Manager (orgs list view). `sf` becomes a runtime prerequisite (detected); the official Salesforce tooling stays an optional recommendation, not a hard dependency.

## 2. Color palette

After the answers, propose the **palette** with `AskUserQuestion` (single question; clickable options from the catalog, recommended default first; the **Other** option covers a remaining named palette and the custom palette). A palette = 5 **light** roles (main background, secondary background, accent, text, details); the dark theme and all supporting tokens are derived (`design-system.md §2`).

- **Palette — `AskUserQuestion`**, options (≤ 4): `Steel Blue` (default, recommended) · `Teal` · `Forest` · `Slate`. The **Other** option covers `Amber`, `Ruby` and a **custom palette**. If the user picks a custom palette, ask the 5 light hex values as free-form text (main background, secondary background, accent, text, details). Catalog + hex values: `design-system.md §2`.
- Steel Blue is the recommended default; the named-palette values are canonical — do not improvise them. If no answer: default palette.
- From the 5 light roles, Claude **derives** and announces: supporting light tokens (`bg-muted`, `bg-elevated`, `text-subtle`, `text-muted`, `border-subtle`, `border-strong`), the 5 accent stops (`primary-50/400/700/800/900`), `onPrimary`, and the **whole dark theme** (lightness targets in `design-system.md §2`). Written to `styles_light.qss` + `styles_dark.qss` (neutrals) and `config.py` (`PRIMARY_*`, `ON_PRIMARY`, `ICON_COLORS`). Semantic colors stay fixed.
- **Contrast check (WCAG AA, non-blocking)**: compute text/bg, text-subtle/bg, accent/bg, onPrimary/accent; if a ratio fails AA, report it (`color — ratio — target`) and ask the user to confirm or adjust before continuing.
- The global `design-system.md` stays unchanged.

## 3. Provisional calibration — announced at the end of Phase 1

Apply the CALIBRATION table in `CLAUDE.md` (canonical source) — it holds the size thresholds, the batch counts, and the +1 batch when tests are enabled (Q5); do not restate them here. The Salesforce CLI integration adds files (`models/sf_cli.py` + the Org Manager view/controller) and pushes the size up (no dedicated batch — the runner ships in Batch 1).

Announce it as **provisional** (template, rendered in the user's language):

Provisional calibration: [Small | Medium/Large] — [N] batches (incl. 1 test batch if enabled)
(Confirmed at the end of Phase 2, after counting the real features.)

The real feature count is not known yet (features are elicited in Phase 2). The calibration is **confirmed and locked at the end of Phase 2**, on the v1.0 feature count.

## 4. Libraries

Any library outside the stack (charts, keyring…) is proposed and validated here — none can be added later without a declaration protocol.

## 5. Write the spec

Write `docs/specs/01-scoping.md` (in the user's language) capturing: objective, DB choice, persistent preferences, i18n, tests (Q5), icon, packaging, Salesforce CLI integration (Yes/No), the **palette** (name or custom; the 5 light roles + the derived dark theme + accent stops + onPrimary; semantic kept fixed) and the contrast-check result, validated libraries, and the provisional calibration (size + number of batches — confirmed in Phase 2). If `docs/specs/` does not exist yet, create it (it will live in the generated project root).

→ Chain to `/python-p2-featuring` after validation.
